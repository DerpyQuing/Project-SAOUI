# Project-SAOUI
SAO Menu System Orion Version

I am redoing the Sword Art Online menu system I made a while ago. 

To be able to run this you will need the following:

1. An Oculus
2. A Leap Motion (w/ Head Mount)
3. Oculus .8 Drivers
4. Leap Motion Orion Runtime (It's in the SDK Download)
5. (Maybe a Myo or 2, still figuring out how to integrate it)
6. Awesomeness

I'm looking to make this version extremely flexible compared to the last. 
The previous one had a ton of things hard coded. That was because I was looking to make an exact replica of the SAO menu system.
With this version, I would like to have an exact replica, but also, the ability to make my own/add features that work around current tech.
Ex. Email, SMS, Phone integration. System/File control. Other fun things.
